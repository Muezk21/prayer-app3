## üì¶ How to Run Locally

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/prayer-app.git
cd prayer-app
```

### 2. Install frontend dependencies

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

### 3. Run the FastAPI backend

```bash
cd backend
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

> The frontend proxies `/api` requests to FastAPI (e.g. `/api/hijri`, `/api/search`). Make sure both servers are running.

npm run test
```

Includes:

- ‚úÖ ‚ÄúNext prayer calculation picks tomorrow Fajr after Isha‚Äù

- Notifications require browser permission and may not work on all devices

---

## ‚ôø Accessibility Considerations

- ARIA labels on interactive elements
- Focus trap inside settings drawer
- Escape key closes drawer
- Color contrast tested for WCAG compliance

## üíº Why This Matters

This project demonstrates:

- Clean architecture with shared context and hooks
- Real-world API integration and proxying
- Accessibility and performance awareness
- CI, linting, and testing discipline
